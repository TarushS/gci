# GCI Tasks
This Repository contains list to all the tasks I completed during Google Code-In :bowtie::octocat:

You can have a look at my blog on [medium](https://blog.usejournal.com/how-i-won-a-free-trip-to-google-google-code-in-2018-bcfa3c4c01d7) to get more information.
### GCI 2017

This was my first GCI. I did about 38 tasks, all to [JBoss Community](https://github.com/JBossOutreach). I did not win anything but then I got to learn a lot.

### GCI 2018

I actually [won](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/01/google-code-in-2018-winners.html) this time and the feeling is amazing. I did about 42 tasks (seems like 42 is the answer to anything & everything in the universe) and with same organization i.e. [JBoss Community](https://github.com/JBossOutreach)
